# Pi-hole Project

Welcome to my first Raspberry Pi project!

## Overview

Pi-hole is a powerful tool that filters out advertisements, trackers, and other unwanted content at the network level. By acting as your DNS server, Pi-hole ensures that ads are blocked before they even reach your devices.

## Features

- **Network-Wide Ad Blocking:** Blocks ads across all devices connected to your network.
- **Customizable Block Lists:** Easily add and manage block lists to tailor your ad-blocking experience.
- **Real-Time Analytics:** View statistics and insights into your network's DNS queries.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple web interface for configuration and monitoring.

## Prerequisites

- A Raspberry Pi or any compatible device running a supported OS (e.g., Raspberry Pi OS).
- Basic knowledge of terminal commands.
- Access to your router's DNS settings.
